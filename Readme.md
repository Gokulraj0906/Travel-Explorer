üîß Development
Adding New Features

1. Backend: Add new routes in app.py
2. Frontend: Update kayal.html with new functionality
3. Database: Modify MongoDB collections as needed

Environment Variables
For production deployment, consider using environment variables:
pythonDownloadCopy code Wrapimport os
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'fallback-secret-key')
app.config['MONGO_URI'] = os.environ.get('MONGO_URI', 'mongodb://localhost:27017/travel_explorer')
üöÄ Deployment
Development
The application runs in debug mode by default. For production:

1. Set Environment Variables:

bashDownloadCopy code Wrapexport FLASK_ENV=production
export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
export MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

1. Use a Production WSGI Server:

bashDownloadCopy code Wrappip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Production Considerations

* Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
* Implement proper logging
* Set up reverse proxy (nginx)
* Use SSL certificates
* Implement rate limiting
* Set up monitoring and error tracking

üß™ Testing
Manual Testing

1. Registration: Create new user accounts
2. Authentication: Test login/logout functionality
3. Booking Flow: Complete booking process
4. Admin Functions: Test admin dashboard features

API Testing
Use tools like Postman or curl to test API endpoints:
bashDownloadCopy code Wrap# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test package listing
curl http://localhost:5000/api/packages
üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues

1. 
MongoDB Connection Error:

Ensure MongoDB service is running
Check connection string in app.py
Verify MongoDB is accessible on port 27017


2. 
CORS Issues:

Flask-CORS is configured to allow all origins in development
For production, configure specific allowed origins


3. 
JWT Token Issues:

Check if token is being sent in Authorization header
Verify token hasn't expired (7-day expiration)


4. 
Database Not Seeding:

Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
Check if collections already exist (seeding only works on empty database)
